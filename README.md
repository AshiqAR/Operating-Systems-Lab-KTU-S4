## Programs
### Cycle 2 (Shell Script)
1. Write a shell script that computes the gross salary of an employee according to the following rules:<br />   (i) if basic salary is < 1500 then HRA =10% of the basic and DA =90% of the basic.<br />   (ii) If basic salary is >=1500 then HRA =Rs.500 and DA=98% of the basic
2. Write a shell script to print all armstrong numbers between two numbers.
3. Write a shell script to find smallest of 3 numbers that are read from keyboard.
4. Write a shell script to validate password strength. Here are a few assumptions for the password string:<br />   Length should be minimum of 8 characters.<br />   Should contain both small and capital case letters, atleast a digit and an underscore(_).<br />   If the password doesn't comply with any of the above conditions, then the script should report it as a "Weak Password".
5. Write a shell script that generate all 3 digit numbers that contain only the digits 0, 1, 2, 3.(number does not start with 0)
6. Write a shell script that finds the smallest prime number greater than n which is palindromic.
7. Write a shell script that sort n numbers.
8. Write a shell script that performs linear search.
